# Division 2 Best Personal Gear (WIP)

I was frusturated with not being able to properly defeat bosses in the Division 2. I also could not find properly updated information on the types of gear or items to use. With no other ideas, I decided to use statistics and sklearn to optimize my in game gear. Using statistics and sklearn I weighted the data to fit my needs for my playstyle. I enjoy playing a very high damage build and being anti-armor. 


## TODO: 
 - Taking into account buffs associated with certain playstyles
 - Finding more updated data sheets (if it exists) to make sure all data is relavent.
