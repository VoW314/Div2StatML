# Division 2 Best Personal Gear (WIP)

I was bored and frusturated with not being able to properly defeat mini-bosses in this game. Therefore, I decided
to find a stat sheet online, and then bias the data with the traits I desire. Using this I found that I do not have the proper set-up
of weapon attributes that I would like to have. 

Used data normalization mainly. Sklearn section just used as a secondary proof


For my build, I prefer a high damage and RPM. I also prefer damage to armor or headshot damage modifiers.


## TODO: 
 - Adding more attributes
 - Adding gear stats so its not just weapon based
